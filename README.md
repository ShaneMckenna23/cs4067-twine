# The Baynes Conspiracyüè°üî™üîç
Murder mystery game built with [Twine](https://twinery.org/) (Snowman v1.3.0). 

## Getting started
It is recommend to clone the repo as the game is asset heavy.
```sh
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/ShaneMckenna23/cs4067-twine.git

cd cs4067-twine

# Runs game in browser
start index.html
```
You can also play the game via GitHub pages [here](https://shanemckenna23.github.io/cs4067-twine/)

The game must be played with a 1920x1080 resolution monitor due to a short deadline.



## Trust System
Each NPC has value attached to them, trust. This trust value goes up or down depending on conversation choices made in Act 1 but will influence the ability to make choices in Act 2. To see these values use developer mode in Chrome and these values will be printed out. 

## Endings
We have 6 different ending sequences. Which one plays depends on the choice made at the start of Act 3. There are 6 different choices of who to accuse, although only one will be unlocked by default. The other 5 endings require pieces of evidence to unlock them.

## Original Artwork
All of our character art was digitally drawn by Darren. Note the period appropriate clothing.

## Theming
We used images, font, audio, and backgrounds to create the feeling of being in Victorian England.

## NPC Interaction
Important pieces of evidence are gained by talking to the NPCs. If the trust is too low, they will not talk to you.
