Use of Javascript
We apologies for any inconvenience in testing parts of our project. Use of Javascript has made some area’s difficult to test.

Trust System
Each NPC has value attached to them, trust. This trust value goes up or down depending on conversation choices made in Act 1 but will influence the ability to make choices in Act 2. To see these values use developer mode in Chrome and these values will be printed out. 

Endings
We have 6 different ending sequences. Which one plays depends on the choice made at the start of Act 3. There are 6 different choices of who to accuse, although only one will be unlocked by default. The other 5 endings require pieces of evidence to unlock them.

Original Artwork
All of our character art was digitally drawn by Darren. Note the period appropriate clothing.

Theming
We used images, font, audio, and backgrounds to create the feeling of being in Victorian England.

NPC Interaction
Important pieces of evidence are gained by talking to the NPCs. If the trust is too low, they will not talk to you.
